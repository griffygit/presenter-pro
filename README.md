<h1>PresenterPro</h1>
<h3>Toolbox of added features for ProPresenter power users!</h3>
<i>(Really just an excuse to solve my specific church's roadblocks)</i>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Screen Freezer</h3>
Freezes and displays the current state of a display as an image "in front of" ProPresenter's output. Allows for you to vamp for time on your main display while you restart ProPresenter or test something.
<h3>Verse List Transcription</h3>
Takes in a list of verses and retrieves the Bible slides for you in a library of your choosing. Great for last minute guest speakers who think the unpaid media team is somehow capable of prepping a bible study in four minutes.
<h3>Dual Display Translation</h3>
Takes a Bible verse from one version and displays the same verse in a different version on a different display. Ideal for multi-screen bilingual churches.
